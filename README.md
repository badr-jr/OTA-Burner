# General Info
- This project Implements Over-The-Air Burner That's Used To Flash hex File On STM32 MCU, Following UART Communication Protocol, Using NodeMCU ESP8266.
- Website is developed and deployed to burn hex on MCU with help of FPEC peripheral.
- Website is hosted on heroku hosting service [Website](https://ota-flasher.herokuapp.com/).
- Peripherals and Drivers: FPEC, SYSYTICK, RCC, UART, GPIO.
- [View Demo](https://youtu.be/bJenN9XARbg).

# Getting Started
- When Final Record In Hex File Is Reached ":00000001FF", The Application Jumps To The New Flashed Program Immediately.
- If 30 Seconds Passed Without Hex Files Received To Be Flashed, The Application Jumps To The Current Flashed Program.

# Technologies and Hardware
- C language
- STM32 MCU
- HTML, CSS, ReactJS
- NodeMCU ESP8266

# Configurations
- In Burner-NodeMCU-ESP8266 There's config file to Set WIFI SSID and Password (credentials_config.h).
